This project/company was made as an exercise for our junior full stack webdeveloper course,
as a first group project. Our goal with this project were to following:
* learning how to collaborate on git/github
* linking multiple pages with multiple inputs and style sheets
* failing in almost everything and learning from this
* showing (maybe to ourselves the most) what we've learned so far
