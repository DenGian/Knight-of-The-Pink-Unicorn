    <p>At <strong>Knights of The Pink Unicorn</strong> we make it our goal to help anybody who has paranormal
        activity
        in their life.
        This can go from Ghosts to demons and anything in between. Our experience gives us all the know-how to
        defeat
        and capture any paranormal being you can think off. The Knights are all trained to perform their tasks.
        Our company exists since 1880, when <strong>Daddy
            Sicco</strong> and <strong>Daddy Tim</strong> created the <strong>Knights of The Pink Unicorn. </strong>

    <!-- "den bosuil" is the real life football stadium of belgian first class team, Antwerp fc and "bosuilstadion" is the official name, but often
    referred to as "den bosuil" so this is a on purpose typo-->

    <!-- Knights of The Pink Unicorn has been spelled on purpose with the capitals on every word beside "of" for esthetic reasons-->
    <p>
        The name <strong>Knights of The Pink Unicorn</strong> stems from our creators first encounter with a paranormal being.
        In 1879 when they started their journey looking for some illustrious code that was rumoured to have emerged.
        After multiple months of following leads, they arrived at <em>den bosuil</em> a football stadium soon to be finished their construction.
        But they know due to their leads that in the foundations of construction there was a notebook with the original code to make the perfect webpage.
        When they made their way down in the foundations and could see the notebook, they were stopped by what seemed to be a <em>pink unicorn</em>.
        But when they shook of their first suprise they realized this unicorn wasn't just pink, it was a <strong>ghost!</strong>.
        Due to not having a single clue how to deal with this they made their way out and tried to do research on how to conquer this paranormal being.
        After few days they succeeded in finding enough information to actually capture this <em>pink unicorn</em>, with the help of some trusty friends,
        they made a spectral coffin that could contain the <em>pink unicorn</em>. So they returned to the foundations of <em>den bosuil</em> were they
        met the <em>pink unicorn</em> once again, but this time they came prepared and lured it into the spectral coffin!
        With the way to the illustrious code free, they went ahead and found the notebook and returned home to try and use this code.
        But after this whole adventure they decided that there have to be more of these beings, similar to the one they just met.
        So their decision was to create an order, which in honor of their adventure, they called <strong>Knights of The Pink Unicorn</strong>
        In time this order became a company due to various reasons, but kept his name for all these years.
